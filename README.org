- *Menu Bar Integration*: Shows daily stats in macOS menu bar
- *Settings Menu*: Configure what stats to display in the menu bar
- *Stillness Leaderboard*: Track your least-mousey days
- *Typing Speed Test*: Built-in WPM test with Monkeytype-style options
- *Charts & Heatmaps*: Visualize your typing patterns over time
- *SQLite Storage*: Persistent local storage of all metrics
